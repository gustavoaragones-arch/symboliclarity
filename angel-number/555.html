    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>555 is often interpreted as a symbol of change, movement, and transition. The number 5 is commonly linked to freedom, flexibility, and the idea that nothing stays fixed. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a prompt to notice what is shifting in your life and how you're responding.</p>
      <p>When 555 appears repeatedly, many associate it with the sense that something is in motion — whether that's a job change, a relationship shift, a move, or an internal reckoning. It doesn't predict what will happen. It invites reflection on how you relate to change. Do you resist it? Welcome it? Feel overwhelmed by it? The sequence can serve as a pause to check in.</p>
      <p>555 is also symbolically linked to adventure and new experiences. It may suggest that you're ready for something different — a new path, a different way of thinking, or the courage to leave behind what no longer fits. That readiness is something you sense; the number doesn't create it. It can, however, draw your attention to it.</p>
      <p>Psychologically, change can trigger both excitement and fear. 555 in this context might simply remind you that transition is a natural part of life. When it catches your eye, it can be a cue to ask: What is changing? What might I be ready to release or embrace? Reflection, not prediction — but the questions themselves can bring clarity.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">555 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 555 is often associated with change and transition. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether your relationship is evolving — or needs to. Sometimes it appears when a relationship is at a crossroads: deeper commitment, separation, or a shift in dynamics.</p>
      <p>For those single, 555 may suggest that you're in a period of change that could open new possibilities. That doesn't guarantee a new partner; it invites you to consider whether you're open to what might come, or whether you're still holding patterns that no longer serve you.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">555 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 555 after a breakup can feel resonant — breakups are change in motion. Many interpret it as a confirmation that you're in transition, and that the discomfort of change is part of the process. It may invite you to consider what you're releasing and what you're moving toward.</p>
      <p>555 in this context can also suggest that more change may come — new routines, new perspectives, new connections. Rather than predicting specifics, it offers a lens: You're not stuck. You're in motion. Reflection can help you move with intention.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">555 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career contexts, 555 is often linked to change — a new job, a shift in direction, or the courage to make a move you've been considering. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether you're resisting or embracing change, and what you might be ready for.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest that your current path is shifting, with or without your direct choice. Economic changes, industry shifts, or personal growth can create transitions. 555 invites you to notice them and consider how you want to respond.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">555 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 555 can feel double-edged. Change can provoke anxiety; it can also be a source of hope. Many interpret 555 in anxious moments as a reminder that change is temporary — whatever you're feeling will shift. Not as a guarantee, but as a perspective that can ease the sense of being permanently stuck.</p>
      <p>It may also prompt you to consider what small change could help: a different routine, a conversation you've avoided, or support you haven't yet sought. If anxiety is persistent, professional care remains important.</p>

      <h2 id="reflection-prompts">Reflection Prompts</h2>
      <p>When 555 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is changing in my life right now — and how do I feel about it?</li>
        <li>Am I resisting change, or am I ready to move with it?</li>
        <li>What might I be ready to release or embrace?</li>
        <li>If I allowed one small change, what would it be?</li>
