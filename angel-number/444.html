    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>444 is often interpreted as a symbol of stability, support, and foundation. The number 4 is commonly linked to structure, reliability, and the idea of building something that lasts. Quadrupled, it can be seen as a strong emphasis: a prompt to notice what is solid in your life and what you're creating.</p>
      <p>When 444 appears repeatedly, many associate it with the sense that you're supported — not necessarily by a specific force, but by the structures you've built: routines, relationships, skills, or inner resilience. It can invite reflection on what holds you steady when things feel uncertain.</p>
      <p>444 is also symbolically linked to hard work and perseverance. It may suggest that your efforts are contributing to something tangible, even when progress feels slow. The "foundation" theme can apply to career, health, relationships, or the way you care for yourself. What are you building? What feels stable?</p>
      <p>Some traditions connect 444 with angels or guides. Symboliclarity doesn't predict who or what supports you; it invites you to reflect. When 444 catches your eye, it can be a cue to pause and ask: Where do I feel supported? What foundations am I tending? The answer is personal. What matters is using the moment for reflection, not as a guarantee of outcomes.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">444 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 444 is often associated with stability and commitment. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether your relationship — or your approach to love — feels grounded. Are you building something lasting? Do you feel safe to be vulnerable?</p>
      <p>For those seeking partnership, 444 may suggest that creating stability within yourself first could matter. When you feel solid on your own, you may be better able to recognize and build a stable connection with another.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">444 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 444 after a breakup can point toward foundation — perhaps the recognition that the relationship lacked stability, or that you're now rebuilding your own. It may invite you to notice what supports you: friends, family, routine, or your own resilience.</p>
      <p>444 in this context can be a reminder that healing often happens through steady, patient work. You're building a new normal. That takes time. Reflection, not prediction — but the theme of stability can be comforting when things feel shaken.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">444 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career contexts, 444 is often linked to stability, hard work, and building something lasting. It can be seen as a prompt to consider whether your efforts are creating a solid foundation — skills, reputation, savings, or relationships that will support future growth.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest that support is available — a mentor, a team, or systems you've put in place. Are you leaning on them? 444 can invite reflection on where you feel supported at work, and where you might need to ask for more.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">444 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 444 can be interpreted as a grounding symbol — a reminder that some things are stable even when the mind races. It may prompt you to name what's solid: your breath, your body, the ground under your feet, a trusted person.</p>
      <p>Building structure — routines, sleep, movement — can ease anxiety. 444 may simply remind you that small, consistent actions create stability. If anxiety persists, professional support is important; symbolism is a complement, not a substitute.</p>

      <p>When 444 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where do I feel supported in my life right now?</li>
        <li>What foundations am I building — and are they the ones I want?</li>
        <li>What would help me feel more stable in body, mind, or circumstance?</li>
        <li>Who or what holds me steady when things feel uncertain?</li>
