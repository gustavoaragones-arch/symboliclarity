    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>777 is often interpreted as a symbol of trust, inner wisdom, and alignment. The number 7 is commonly linked to introspection, spirituality, and the idea of knowing something beyond surface evidence. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a prompt to trust what you already know and to notice where you're in alignment with yourself.</p>
      <p>When 777 appears repeatedly, many associate it with the sense that you're on a path that fits you — not necessarily an easy path, but one that resonates. It can invite reflection on whether you're trusting your intuition, your experience, and your ability to navigate uncertainty. That trust isn't blind; it's built on paying attention to what has worked, what you've learned, and what feels true.</p>
      <p>777 is also symbolically linked to solitude and reflection. The number 7 has long been associated with contemplation — the hermit, the seeker, the one who turns inward for answers. When 777 shows up, it may suggest that you already have access to the clarity you're seeking; you might need quiet or space to hear it.</p>
      <p>Some traditions connect 777 with luck or divine favor. Symboliclarity doesn't predict outcomes. It invites you to reflect: What do I already know? Where am I trusting myself, and where am I doubting? When 777 catches your eye, it can be a cue to pause and tune in — not to a prediction, but to your own wisdom.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">777 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 777 is often associated with trust and alignment. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether you're trusting your own judgment about a relationship — or whether you're ignoring doubts or red flags. Inner wisdom isn't infallible, but it's worth attending to.</p>
      <p>For those in partnership, 777 may suggest that you and your partner are aligned in meaningful ways, or that it's a good time to check in on that. For those single, it might invite reflection on whether you trust yourself to know what you want and to recognize it when it appears.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">777 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 777 after a breakup can point toward trust — perhaps trust in the process of healing, or trust that you know what you need. It may invite you to turn inward rather than seeking external validation or a quick fix.</p>
      <p>777 in this context can also suggest that you're gaining wisdom from the experience. What have you learned? What do you know now that you didn't before? Reflection on that can support healing and clarity about what you want next.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">777 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career contexts, 777 is often linked to trust in your path and your skills. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether you're trusting your expertise, your judgment, or your readiness for the next step. Sometimes we need external validation; sometimes we need to give it to ourselves.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest that you're aligned with work that fits you — or that it's time to consider whether your current path still resonates. Trust in the process doesn't mean passive waiting; it can mean trusting yourself to make decisions and take action.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">777 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 777 can be interpreted as a grounding symbol — a reminder that you have weathered uncertainty before and that you have inner resources to draw on. It may prompt you to recall times when you trusted yourself and it worked out, or when you found clarity after doubt.</p>
      <p>Trust doesn't erase anxiety, but it can loosen its grip. 777 may invite you to ask: What do I already know that could calm me? If anxiety persists, professional support is important.</p>

      <h2 id="reflection-prompts">Reflection Prompts</h2>
      <p>When 777 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What do I already know that I might be overlooking?</li>
        <li>Where am I trusting myself, and where am I doubting?</li>
        <li>What would it feel like to trust the process a little more?</li>
        <li>When have I found clarity by turning inward?</li>
