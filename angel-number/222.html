    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>222 is often interpreted as a symbol of balance, partnership, and patience. The number 2 is commonly linked to duality, cooperation, and the idea of two forces working together. Tripled, it can be seen as an emphasis: a nudge to notice where harmony or cooperation matters in your life.</p>
      <p>This sequence can be associated with timing — the sense that some things unfold in their own rhythm. When 222 appears repeatedly, many see it as a prompt to slow down and consider whether pushing harder is helpful, or whether patience and trust in the process might serve you better. That doesn't mean inaction. It means reflection before action.</p>
      <p>Psychologically, the idea of balance resonates when we feel pulled in opposing directions — work and rest, giving and receiving, planning and letting go. 222 can function as a reflective cue: Where am I out of balance? What might restore a sense of equilibrium?</p>
      <p>Partnership is another theme often linked to 222. It can extend to romantic relationships, friendships, collaborations, or the relationship you have with yourself. The sequence may invite you to consider whether you're showing up in ways that support connection, or whether something is askew. As with all symbolic meanings, interpretation is personal. What matters is how you use the moment — as an invitation to reflect, not as a guarantee of outcomes.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">222 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 222 is often associated with partnership, cooperation, and mutual support. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether you and your partner — or you and a potential partner — are moving in alignment. Are you both investing? Are you both listening? Balance in love doesn't mean perfect symmetry; it means a sense that both people matter.</p>
      <p>For those waiting or wondering about timing, 222 may suggest that patience could be part of the picture. Not as a promise that someone will appear, but as an invitation to consider whether you're ready for what you say you want, and whether rushing would serve you.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">222 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 222 after a breakup can feel tender. Many associate it with the idea of balance — perhaps the recognition that the relationship was out of balance, or that you're now seeking equilibrium within yourself. It can be interpreted as a gentle prompt to give yourself time.</p>
      <p>Patience with your own healing is often part of what 222 symbolizes in this context. Rather than predicting a new romance, it may invite you to reflect on what you learned about partnership, and what balance might look like in your next chapter.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">222 in Career</h2>
      <p>In work contexts, 222 is often linked to collaboration and timing. It can be seen as a prompt to consider whether you're working with others effectively, or whether a project needs more time to ripen before you push forward. Some interpret it as a nudge to seek partnership — a co-founder, mentor, or ally.</p>
      <p>Balance between effort and rest can also be relevant. Burnout often comes from ignoring the need for equilibrium. 222 may simply remind you to check in: Am I overextending? What would balance look like here?</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">222 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 222 can be interpreted as a grounding symbol — a reminder that balance is possible, even when things feel chaotic. It may suggest that pacing yourself, rather than racing, could ease some of the pressure.</p>
      <p>Partnership can matter here too: Are you isolating, or are you reaching out? Sometimes the "2" energy is about not carrying everything alone. If anxiety persists, symbolic reflection is a complement, not a replacement, for professional support.</p>

      <h2 id="reflection-prompts">Reflection Prompts</h2>
      <p>When 222 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where do I feel out of balance, and what would help?</li>
        <li>In my relationships, am I giving and receiving in a way that feels right?</li>
        <li>Is there an area where patience might serve me better than pushing?</li>
        <li>What would partnership — with another or with myself — look like if I invited it?</li>
