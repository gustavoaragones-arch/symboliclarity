    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>999 is often interpreted as a symbol of closure, release, and completion. The number 9 is commonly linked to endings, wisdom gathered through experience, and the idea that one cycle must end before another can begin. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a prompt to notice what is ready to complete and what you might be ready to release.</p>
      <p>When 999 appears repeatedly, many associate it with the sense that something is coming to a natural end — a job, a relationship, a phase of life, or a way of thinking. Endings can be painful, but they also create space. 999 doesn't predict what will end or when. It invites reflection on what might be finished and what could open up if you allow it.</p>
      <p>999 is also symbolically linked to service and contribution. The number 9 is sometimes associated with having given what you can and being ready to move on. It may suggest that you've completed a role or a task, and that holding on longer would not serve you or others. Release, in this sense, can be an act of integrity.</p>
      <p>Psychologically, endings trigger grief even when they're chosen. 999 can be a cue to honor that — to allow yourself to feel the loss, to mark the transition, and to reflect on what you're carrying forward. When it catches your eye, it can be an invitation to ask: What is ending? What am I ready to let go of? Reflection, not prediction — but the questions can bring clarity.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">999 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 999 is often associated with closure and completion. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether a relationship has run its course — or whether you're ready to release old patterns (attachment styles, expectations, wounds) that no longer serve you. Endings in love are hard; 999 doesn't make them easy, but it may validate the impulse to complete something.</p>
      <p>For those in partnership, it might suggest that a phase of the relationship is ending — conflict, distance, or a way of relating — and that something new could begin if both people are willing. For those healing from loss, 999 may invite reflection on what you're ready to release so you can open to what comes next.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">999 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 999 after a breakup can feel pointed. Many interpret it as a confirmation that the ending was part of a larger cycle — that something needed to complete. It may invite you to reflect on what you're releasing: the relationship itself, hopes you had, or identity tied to being partnered.</p>
      <p>999 in this context can also suggest that you're nearing the end of a grief cycle — not that you'll forget, but that you might be ready to close a chapter and turn the page. Reflection, not prediction — but the theme of completion can offer a sense of forward motion.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">999 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career contexts, 999 is often linked to completion and transition. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether your current role, project, or path has reached its natural end. Sometimes we stay out of comfort or fear; 999 may invite you to consider whether it's time to move on.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest that you've given what you can to a situation and that continuing would be diminishing returns. Completing a cycle with integrity — leaving well, finishing well — can matter as much as the next step.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">999 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 999 can feel unsettling — endings often do. But it can also be interpreted as a reminder that anxiety itself can complete a cycle. Worry doesn't last forever; neither do difficult phases. 999 may invite you to consider what you're ready to release: perfectionism, control, or the belief that you must hold everything together.</p>
      <p>Letting go of coping strategies that no longer work can be part of healing. If anxiety is persistent, professional support is important; 999 is a reflective lens, not a substitute for care.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What might be ready to end in my life right now?</li>
        <li>What am I holding on to that no longer serves me?</li>
        <li>What would it feel like to release it — and what might open up?</li>
        <li>How can I honor this ending before moving to what's next?</li>
