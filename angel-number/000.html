    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>000 can be interpreted as a symbol of wholeness, potential, and fresh starts. Zero is commonly linked to the void, the infinite, and the idea of nothing — which is also everything before it takes form. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a prompt to notice the blank slate, the moment before something begins, or the wholeness that exists beneath the busy surface of life.</p>
      <p>When 000 appears repeatedly, many associate it with the sense that you're at a beginning — or that you could be. Zero contains all numbers; it's the seed of possibility. 000 doesn't predict what will grow. It invites reflection on what you might be ready to plant, what you're clearing space for, or what has been emptied so something new can fill it.</p>
      <p>000 is also symbolically linked to unity and the divine. In some traditions, zero represents the unmanifest — the source before differentiation. It can suggest that beneath the divisions and labels of daily life, there is a wholeness you can touch. That might mean meditation, nature, art, or simply a moment of stillness. How you experience it is personal.</p>
      <p>Psychologically, zero can evoke both freedom and anxiety. A blank page can be liberating or overwhelming. 000 in this context might simply invite you to notice how you respond to possibility: Do you lean in or pull back? What would it feel like to embrace the unknown for a moment? When 000 catches your eye, it can be a cue to pause and ask: What is beginning? What am I ready to create? Reflection, not prediction — but the questions can open doors.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">000 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 000 is often associated with fresh starts and potential. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether you're approaching love from a place of openness or from old patterns. A "zero" state might mean releasing expectations, past hurt, or the need to control outcomes — so you can meet what comes with curiosity.</p>
      <p>For those in partnership, 000 may suggest a moment to reset — to return to the blank slate of "we're choosing each other today" rather than carrying accumulated resentments. For those single, it might invite reflection on whether you're open to what could be, or whether you're holding the past in place.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">000 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 000 after a breakup can point toward the blank slate — the recognition that the relationship has ended and that something new is possible. It may invite you to consider what you're clearing space for. Emptiness can feel like loss; it can also be the condition for something new.</p>
      <p>000 in this context can suggest that you're at the beginning of a new chapter, even when it doesn't feel like it yet. Grief has its own timeline. Reflection, not prediction — but the theme of potential can offer a gentle nudge toward the future.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">000 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career contexts, 000 is often linked to new beginnings and potential. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether you're ready to start something new — a project, a role, a direction — or whether you've been holding back out of fear of the blank page. Sometimes the void is exactly where creation happens.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest that a phase has cleared and you're in the "in between." That can be disorienting. 000 might invite you to sit with the not-knowing rather than rushing to fill it. What wants to emerge?</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">000 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 000 can feel paradoxical. Emptiness can trigger anxiety — we often prefer the devil we know. But 000 can also be interpreted as a reminder that you are whole even when you feel scattered. Beneath the noise, there is stillness. You can return to it.</p>
      <p>Breath, grounding, and the present moment are often ways to touch that wholeness. 000 may simply remind you that you don't have to have everything figured out. If anxiety persists, professional support remains important.</p>

      <h2 id="reflection-prompts">Reflection Prompts</h2>
      <p>When 000 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is beginning — or what could begin — in my life right now?</li>
        <li>What would it feel like to embrace the blank slate instead of fearing it?</li>
        <li>Where do I feel wholeness, even briefly? How can I return there?</li>
        <li>What am I ready to create that I haven't yet allowed?</li>
