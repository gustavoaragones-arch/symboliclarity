    <!-- ========== CORE MEANING ========== -->
    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>When 111 appears repeatedly — on clocks, receipts, license plates — it tends to catch attention. In many symbolic traditions, it is often interpreted as a sign of alignment and new beginnings. The number 1 is commonly linked to initiation, unity, and the idea of a fresh start. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a prompt to notice where you are and what might be shifting.</p>
      <p>111 can symbolize alignment between thought and action. It may invite you to consider whether your choices match what you say you want. This is not about prediction or certainty — it is about reflection. When a pattern stands out, it can serve as a pause button: What am I ready to pay attention to? What might be coming into focus?</p>
      <p>Psychologically, noticing repeated numbers is a form of pattern recognition. Once we become aware of a sequence, we tend to see it more often. That doesn't diminish its usefulness. The act of pausing when 111 appears can itself create clarity. It can prompt you to check in with your intentions, your goals, or the direction of a relationship or project.</p>
      <p>111 is also symbolically linked to the idea of unity and wholeness. Some see it as a reminder that mind, body, and spirit — or thought, word, and deed — can be brought into coherence. Whether that resonates is personal. What matters is how you use the moment: as an invitation to reflect, not as a guarantee of outcomes.</p>

    <!-- ========== CONTEXT SECTIONS ========== -->
    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">111 in Love</h2>
      <p>In relationship contexts, 111 is often associated with alignment — between partners, with your own values, or with what you want to invite. It can be seen as a reflective prompt: Are my actions in sync with what I say I value in love? Am I showing up in a way that matches my intentions?</p>
      <p>For those in a partnership, it may suggest a moment to notice whether you and your partner are moving in the same direction. For those single or exploring, it can be a nudge to clarify what you're open to and what you're ready for. No outcome is promised — only an invitation to reflect.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">111 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 111 after a breakup can feel layered. Many associate it with new beginnings — the idea that an ending creates space for something different. It can be interpreted as a gentle prompt to consider what you might be ready to release and what you want to carry forward.</p>
      <p>Rather than predicting a new relationship, 111 in this context often functions as a lens for reflection: What have I learned? What do I want to align with in my next chapter? Taking time to answer those questions can bring more clarity than seeking a quick prediction.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">111 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career or work contexts, 111 is often interpreted as a symbol of initiative and fresh starts. It can be seen as a prompt to notice where you're taking the lead, where you might be ready to begin something new, or where your efforts are aligned with your goals.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest a moment to consider whether your current path feels right. Are you building toward what matters to you? Reflection, not prediction, is the focus here.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">111 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When you're anxious, repeated numbers can feel either soothing or intensifying. 111 is often framed as a reminder of alignment and presence — a nudge to ground in the present moment rather than spiral into what-ifs.</p>
      <p>If 111 appears during a anxious period, it can be useful to treat it as a pause: Breathe. Notice where you are. What one small step can you take right now? Symbolic meaning works best as support for reflection, not as a substitute for professional care if anxiety is ongoing.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="reflection-prompts">
      <h2 id="reflection-prompts">Reflection Prompts</h2>
      <p>When 111 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where am I aligned with my intentions, and where am I not?</li>
        <li>What might be beginning or wanting to begin in my life?</li>
        <li>What do I notice when I pause and tune in right now?</li>
        <li>If I were to take one small step toward clarity, what would it be?</li>
