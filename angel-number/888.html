    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>888 is often interpreted as a symbol of abundance, cycles, and completion. The number 8 is commonly linked to infinity (turned on its side), cycles, and the idea of flow — what goes around comes around, what is sown is reaped. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a prompt to notice what is flowing in your life and what might be completing a cycle.</p>
      <p>When 888 appears repeatedly, many associate it with abundance — not only material wealth, but the sense that something is in full bloom: a relationship, a project, a phase of growth. It can invite reflection on what you have, what you're building, and what might be reaching a natural completion. Completion isn't always positive; sometimes cycles end so new ones can begin.</p>
      <p>888 is also symbolically linked to balance and reciprocity. The figure-8 shape suggests equilibrium: give and take, effort and reward. It may prompt you to consider whether you're in flow — with your work, your relationships, your energy — or whether something is blocked. Flow doesn't mean passivity; it can mean alignment between action and result.</p>
      <p>Some traditions connect 888 with prosperity or luck. Symboliclarity doesn't predict financial outcomes. It invites you to reflect: What is abundant in my life right now? What cycle is completing or beginning? When 888 catches your eye, it can be a cue to pause and notice — not to expect a guarantee, but to tune into what is already flowing.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">888 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 888 is often associated with abundance and flow. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on what is rich in your relationship — connection, shared experience, mutual support — or what might be coming full circle. For some, it appears when a relationship is deepening or when a cycle of conflict is resolving.</p>
      <p>For those single, 888 may suggest that you're in a phase of abundance in other areas of life, which can create readiness for love. Or it might invite reflection on what you have to give and receive — and whether you're open to that exchange.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">888 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 888 after a breakup can point toward completion — the recognition that a cycle has ended. It may invite you to reflect on what the relationship gave you (lessons, growth, memories) and what you're now free to build. Abundance in this context might mean the abundance of possibility ahead.</p>
      <p>888 in this context can also suggest that healing has its own rhythm. Some cycles take longer to complete. Reflection, not prediction — but the theme of flow can be a reminder that you're not stuck forever.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">888 in Career</h2>
      <p>In career contexts, 888 is often linked to abundance and reward. It can be seen as a prompt to reflect on whether your efforts are flowing toward results — and whether you're recognizing what you've already built. Sometimes we overlook our own abundance in the rush for more.</p>
      <p>It may also suggest that a professional cycle is completing: a project finishing, a role evolving, or a phase of hustle giving way to consolidation. Reflection on what is flowing and what is ending can inform your next steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">888 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is high, 888 can be interpreted as a reminder of abundance — not to dismiss your fears, but to widen the lens. What do you have that supports you? What is flowing even when it doesn't feel like it? Sometimes naming abundance can ease the sense of scarcity that anxiety amplifies.</p>
      <p>Cycles can also offer comfort: this phase will not last forever. 888 may invite you to consider what is temporary and what endures. If anxiety persists, professional support remains important.</p>

      <p>When 888 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is abundant in my life right now — material and non-material?</li>
        <li>What cycle might be completing, and what could begin next?</li>
        <li>Where do I feel in flow, and where do I feel blocked?</li>
        <li>What have I built or received that I might be taking for granted?</li>
