    <section aria-labelledby="core-meaning">
      <h2 id="core-meaning">Core Meaning</h2>
      <p>333 is often interpreted as a symbol of creativity, expression, and growth. The number 3 is commonly linked to communication, expansion, and the idea of bringing something into form — whether that's an idea, a project, or a truth you've been holding back. Tripled, it can be seen as an amplification: a nudge to notice what wants to be said or created.</p>
      <p>Many associate 333 with the creative process — not just art, but any act of making something visible: a conversation, a boundary, a new direction. When this sequence appears, it may invite you to consider whether you're expressing yourself fully, or whether something is being held in that wants out.</p>
      <p>333 can also be symbolically linked to growth and expansion. It might prompt reflection on where you're stretching, learning, or stepping into something larger. Growth isn't always comfortable; sometimes 333 shows up when you're on the edge of a leap and need a gentle push to trust yourself.</p>
      <p>Spiritually, some traditions connect 333 with trinity — mind, body, spirit; past, present, future; or other threefold concepts. Whether that resonates is personal. What matters is how you use the moment: as an invitation to reflect on expression and creativity, not as a guarantee of outcomes. When 333 catches your eye, it can be a prompt to ask: What am I ready to communicate? What wants to be brought into the light?</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="love-context">
      <h2 id="love-context">333 in Love</h2>
      <p>In love, 333 is often associated with communication and expression. It can be seen as a prompt to speak your truth — to share feelings, needs, or desires that have been unspoken. Many interpret it as a nudge to have the conversation you've been avoiding.</p>
      <p>For those in partnership, it may suggest that creative expression — play, curiosity, trying something new together — could deepen connection. For those single, it might invite reflection on how you express what you want in love, and whether you're clear with yourself and others.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="breakup-context">
      <h2 id="breakup-context">333 After a Breakup</h2>
      <p>Seeing 333 after a breakup can point toward expression and release. It may prompt you to consider what you need to say — to yourself, to your ex, or to a trusted friend. Unspoken words can weigh heavily; 333 can be a cue to find a safe outlet.</p>
      <p>Creativity can also be part of the picture. Some find that making something — writing, art, music — helps process loss. 333 in this context may simply remind you that expression is part of healing, not a prediction of what comes next.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="career-context">
      <h2 id="career-context">333 in Career</h2>
      <p>In work contexts, 333 is often linked to creativity, collaboration, and communication. It can be seen as a prompt to share your ideas, speak up in meetings, or pitch that project you've been sitting on. Many interpret it as a nudge to make your contribution visible.</p>
      <p>Growth and expansion are also relevant. 333 may suggest that you're ready for a larger role, a new skill, or a different approach. Reflection, not prediction — but the question "What am I ready to express?" can be useful.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="anxiety-context">
      <h2 id="anxiety-context">333 and Anxiety</h2>
      <p>When anxiety is present, 333 can be interpreted as a prompt to express what you're feeling — to name it, share it, or write it down. Keeping fears bottled up often intensifies them; giving them form can create distance and clarity.</p>
      <p>Creativity can also offer relief. Even simple acts — doodling, journaling, talking to a friend — can shift the nervous system. 333 may remind you that expression is a form of release. If anxiety is persistent, professional support remains important.</p>

      <h2 id="reflection-prompts">Reflection Prompts</h2>
      <p>When 333 shows up, you might sit with questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What am I not saying that wants to be said?</li>
        <li>Where could I express myself more fully — in work, love, or creativity?</li>
        <li>What wants to be created or brought into form?</li>
        <li>Where am I growing, and am I trusting that process?</li>
