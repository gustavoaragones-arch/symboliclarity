      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="represents-heading">
        <h2 id="represents-heading">What the Suit of Wands Represents</h2>
        <p>The suit of Wands is traditionally linked to the element of fire. In symbolic terms, fire suggests energy that moves outward: action, initiative, and the drive to create or to lead. Wands cards do not predict success or failure. They reflect psychological territory — the part of life where you are taking initiative, asserting direction, or dealing with the heat of passion, ambition, or conflict. When Wands appear in a reading, they often point to where momentum, creativity, or the need to stand your ground is in play. The suit can also highlight the shadow side of fire: impulsivity, burnout, or the cost of constant drive. Our interpretations stay reflective: we describe themes and invite you to consider how they relate to your situation, without claiming outcomes.</p>
        <p>Core associations for Wands include action (the step from idea to doing), initiative (the willingness to start or to lead), creative force (the energy that builds and expresses), and momentum (the sense that things are in motion). Reversed Wands may reflect blocked or misdirected fire — hesitation, scattered energy, or aggression without clarity. As with all suits, upright and reversed are angles for reflection, not fixed positive or negative labels.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="growth-heading">
        <h2 id="growth-heading">Wands and Personal Growth</h2>
        <p>In the context of personal growth, Wands often reflect identity and ambition — who you are when you are in motion, and what you are building toward. The suit can invite reflection on whether your drive is aligned with your values or whether you are running on autopilot. It may also highlight the balance between action and rest: fire that never banks can burn out, while fire that never ignites can leave you feeling stuck. Growth here might involve clarifying your direction, owning your desire to lead or create, and learning when to push and when to pause. We do not use Wands to tell you that you will succeed or that you must hustle; we use them as mirrors for how you relate to initiative and momentum.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="relationships-heading">
        <h2 id="relationships-heading">Wands in Relationships</h2>
        <p>In relationships, Wands often touch on passion, conflict, and desire. The suit can reflect the energy you bring to partnership — the urge to pursue, to inspire, or to take the lead — as well as the friction that sometimes comes when two people’s wills or rhythms clash. Wands do not predict whether a relationship will last or ignite. They invite awareness of how you handle disagreement, how you express desire, and whether the dynamic feels balanced or one-sided. Reversed Wands in a relational context may point to blocked passion, passive aggression, or the need to cool down before speaking or acting.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="career-heading">
        <h2 id="career-heading">Wands in Career & Direction</h2>
        <p>In career and life direction, Wands often symbolize leadership, drive, and risk-taking. The suit may reflect the part of you that wants to pitch the idea, take the project, or step into a role that requires visibility and initiative. It can also highlight the cost of overwork or the tension between ambition and sustainability. We do not use Wands to promise promotion or to advise you to quit your job. We use them to support reflection on how you channel your energy at work, what you are willing to fight for, and where you might be holding back or burning out.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="numerology-heading">
        <h2 id="numerology-heading">Numerology in the Suit of Wands</h2>
        <p>The numbered cards (Ace through Ten) in Wands can be read as a loose psychological progression. The Ace often represents the spark — a new idea, a burst of energy, or the moment of “I want to start.” The Two can suggest vision and choice — weighing options, planning the next move. The Three may reflect expansion and the first results of that initiative. The Four can symbolize a pause to celebrate or stabilize. The Five often introduces tension — competition, conflict, or the need to find common ground. The Six may reflect recognition or visibility. The Seven can suggest defending your position. The Eight often points to swift movement and momentum. The Nine may reflect resilience and boundaries. The Ten can suggest burden or the question of what you are carrying. This progression is not a fixed script; it is a way to notice how the number and the suit interact — early numbers often lean toward beginnings and momentum, later numbers toward consolidation, tension, or weight.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="court-heading">
        <h2 id="court-heading">Court Cards in Wands</h2>
        <p>The court cards in Wands (Page, Knight, Queen, King) are often read as aspects of personality or as people who carry Wands energy. The <strong>Page of Wands</strong> may reflect curiosity, exploration, and the spirit of discovery — a new idea or message in the realm of action. The <strong>Knight of Wands</strong> often symbolizes boldness, enthusiasm, and the drive to move — the energy of pursuit or adventure, sometimes at the cost of patience. The <strong>Queen of Wands</strong> may reflect confidence, independence, and creative warmth — your own vitality and presence, or someone who embodies that. The <strong>King of Wands</strong> can suggest leadership, vision, and the ability to inspire — taking charge or stepping into authority. Court cards do not predict who will appear in your life; they offer archetypal angles for reflection, including the possibility that you are being invited to embody more (or less) of that energy yourself.</p>
