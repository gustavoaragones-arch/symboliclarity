      <h1 class="article__title">Six of Cups — Tarot Card Meaning</h1>

      <p class="article__intro">Many decks picture the Six of Cups as figures exchanging or tending cups, often in a setting that suggests the past — a village, a garden, or a scene that feels like memory. In the <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/">suit of Cups</a>, which is linked to water, emotion, and the inner life, the Six marks a turn after loss: nostalgia, the influence of the past, and the way memory shapes what we feel in the present. This card does not predict that you will reunite with someone or that the past will repeat. It reflects the psychological experience of looking back — the comfort of what was, the weight of what we carry, and the question of whether the past is guiding you or holding you. When the Six of Cups surfaces in a reading, it may invite reflection on how the past lives in you and on what you choose to remember and to offer. Explore all cards in the <a href="/tarot/meanings/">Tarot Meaning Library</a>. We offer reflective, emotionally intelligent themes, not predictions.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="upright-heading">
        <h2 id="upright-heading">Upright Reflection</h2>
        <p>Upright, the Six of Cups often reflects a phase when the past is present — when you are thinking about how things were, reconnecting with someone from an earlier time, or feeling the comfort or the weight of memory. You may be revisiting a place, a relationship, or a version of yourself that lives in the past. The card does not tell you that the past was better or that you should go back. It symbolizes the psychological quality of nostalgia: the way the heart holds what was, and the way that holding can both comfort and constrain. The image of cups being offered — often from one figure to another, or from the past to the present — suggests that something from then is being given to now: a lesson, a feeling, or a connection that crosses time.</p>
        <p>That offering can be gentle. <a href="/tarot/meanings/the-star/">The Star</a> offers hope; the Six of Cups offers the gift of the past. The Six can reflect the value of memory — the people and experiences that shaped you, the simplicity you sometimes long for, or the reconnection that brings warmth. It may point to the gift of the past: the mentor who reappears, the friend you had lost touch with, or the insight that comes when you look back with clarity. The upright Six invites you to notice how the past is living in you — as comfort, as burden, or as both. It can also reflect the shadow of nostalgia: the habit of idealizing what was, the refusal to see the present clearly because the past seems safer, or the tendency to repeat old patterns because they feel familiar. Growth here may involve the capacity to honor the past without being ruled by it — to take what is useful from memory and to leave behind what no longer serves. <a href="/tarot/meanings/temperance/">Temperance</a> blends past and present; the Six of Cups offers the gift of memory without demanding we live in it.</p>
        <p>The Six suggests that the emotional progression in Cups includes the integration of what was lost; the work is to let memory inform the present without replacing it. This reflects the broader energy of the <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/">suit of Cups</a>: memory and the past’s gift.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="reversed-heading">
        <h2 id="reversed-heading">Reversed Reflection</h2>
        <p>Reversed, the Six of Cups often reflects a shift in that same territory of past and memory. The <a href="/tarot/meanings/pentacles/six-of-pentacles/">Six of Pentacles</a> gives and receives; the reversed Six of Cups can mark the turn away from the past. You may be pulling free from the grip of nostalgia — choosing to live in the present, to not idealize what was, or to break a pattern that was rooted in the past. It can symbolize the moment when you stop offering the same old cup or when you refuse the one that is being offered from “back then.” Reversed does not mean the past does not matter. It can indicate that the energy of the Six is blocked or turning: that you are ready to put the past in its place, that you are questioning the stories you have told about how things were, or that you are choosing to build something new rather than to recreate what was.</p>
        <p>Some people encounter this when they have been stuck in nostalgia — unable to move forward because the past felt safer or more vivid. The reversal can reflect the decision to step into the present. It may also point to the risk of cutting off the past entirely — of refusing the gift of memory, of dismissing reconnection, or of believing that to grow you must forget. The reversed Six invites awareness of whether you are freeing yourself from the past with integration or with rejection. The aim is to let the past inform without dominate — to take what is useful and to release what holds you back.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="relationships-heading">
        <h2 id="relationships-heading">In Relationships</h2>
        <p>In relationships, the Six of Cups often reflects the influence of the past on the connection — an old flame reappearing, the weight of how things were with a partner, or the way your history shapes what you expect and offer. It may symbolize reconnection with someone from your past or the comfort of a relationship that feels rooted in shared history. The card does not predict that the reconnection will last or that the past will repeat. It invites reflection on how the past is present in the relationship — as warmth, as burden, or as both — and on whether you are offering and receiving in the present or living in the shadow of what was. We do not use this card to suggest that someone from the past is “meant” to return; we use it to reflect the psychological pull of memory and the choice of how to respond.</p>
        <p>Reversed in a relational context, it may point to leaving the past behind — choosing the present relationship over the ghost of an old one, or breaking a pattern that was rooted in earlier experience. Reflection might focus on what you are ready to release and what you are ready to build.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="career-heading">
        <h2 id="career-heading">In Career & Direction</h2>
        <p>In career and life direction, the Six of Cups often symbolizes the pull of the past — the path you did not take, the role you used to have, or the way your history influences your choices now. The <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/ten-of-cups/">Ten of Cups</a> holds emotional completion; the Six holds the gift of memory. It may reflect reconnection with a former colleague , mentor, or vocation, or the comfort of returning to something familiar. The card does not tell you to go back or to stay away. It invites reflection on how the past is guiding you and on whether that guidance is freeing or limiting. The Six can also point to the gift of experience — the skills and relationships you carry from earlier chapters.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="growth-heading">
        <h2 id="growth-heading">As Personal Growth</h2>
        <p>As a mirror for personal growth, the Six of Cups highlights the relationship between past and present. Growth in the emotional realm often requires making peace with what was — to honor memory without being ruled by it, to take the gifts of the past without demanding that the present replicate them. The card can reflect the work of reconnection — with people, with places, or with parts of yourself that you had put aside. It may also invite awareness of nostalgia’s shadow: the habit of idealizing the past or of refusing to see the present because it is harder. The Six suggests that the past is a resource and a potential trap; the work is to use it with intention.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="yes-no-heading">
        <h2 id="yes-no-heading">Is the Six of Cups a Yes or No Card?</h2>
        <p>The Six of Cups is not inherently a yes or no card. Tarot reflects themes and energy. Upright, many people experience it as a leaning toward “revisit” or “reconnect” — the sense that the past has something to offer. Reversed, it may lean toward “move on” or “live in the present” — suggesting that the pull of the past is loosening. Even then, the card invites reflection on memory and nostalgia rather than a single answer. Your context will shape how you use it.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="combined-heading">
        <h2 id="combined-heading">When the Six of Cups Appears With Other Cards</h2>
        <p><strong>The Six of Cups and <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/five-of-cups/">Five of Cups</a>:</strong> Nostalgia follows loss — what is spilled and what is remembered. Together they may reflect the role of memory in grief and in comfort.</p>
        <p><strong>The Six of Cups and <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/seven-of-cups/">Seven of Cups</a>:</strong> The past meets fantasy — memory and the many options of the imagination. This pairing can suggest the need to distinguish what was from what you imagine.</p>
        <p><strong>The Six of Cups and <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/page-of-cups/">Page of Cups</a>:</strong> Nostalgia meets innocent feeling. Together they may reflect the reconnection with a younger self or with the quality of openness. See the <a href="/tarot/meanings/cups/">Cups court cards</a> for the Page.</p>

        <h2 id="when-you-feel-heading">When You Feel…</h2>
        <p><strong>Nostalgic:</strong> The Six can mirror that pull and invite reflection on what the past is offering — and what it might be obscuring.</p>
        <p><strong>Reconnecting with someone from the past:</strong> It often reflects the exchange between then and now — and the choice of how to hold it.</p>
        <p><strong>Stuck in “how things used to be”:</strong> The Six reversed may suggest the need to put the past in its place and to turn toward the present.</p>
        <p><strong>Grateful for your history:</strong> The card can affirm the gift of memory and the value of what shaped you.</p>
        <p><strong>Ready to release an old story:</strong> The Six reversed can reflect the decision to stop living in the shadow of the past.</p>
