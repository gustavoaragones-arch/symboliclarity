      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="represents-heading">
        <h2 id="represents-heading">What the Suit of Cups Represents</h2>
        <p>The suit of Cups is traditionally linked to the element of water. In symbolic terms, water suggests flow, depth, and what we feel — emotion, intuition, and the realm of connection and relationship. Cups cards do not predict love or loss. They reflect psychological territory: where you are in touch with feeling, where you are numb or overflowing, and where relationship and inner experience meet. When Cups appear in a reading, they often point to the emotional undertone of a situation — what is being felt, what is being avoided, or what is seeking expression. The suit can also highlight the shadow side of water: overwhelm, withdrawal, or the confusion between fantasy and reality. Our interpretations stay reflective: we describe themes and invite you to consider how they relate to your inner life, without claiming outcomes.</p>
        <p>Core associations for Cups include emotion (the full range of feeling), intuition (the sense that comes before words), connection (partnership, friendship, belonging), and the inner world (dreams, memory, what we carry in the heart). Reversed Cups may reflect blocked or overflowing emotion — difficulty feeling, difficulty containing, or the need to distinguish what is real from what is hoped or feared. As with all suits, upright and reversed are angles for reflection, not fixed positive or negative labels.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="growth-heading">
        <h2 id="growth-heading">Cups and Personal Growth</h2>
        <p>In the context of personal growth, Cups often reflect the relationship you have with your own emotions — whether you allow yourself to feel, to need, and to receive. The suit can invite reflection on emotional patterns: where you overflow, where you shut down, and where you confuse longing with love. Growth here might involve learning to sit with discomfort, to honor what you feel without being ruled by it, and to distinguish between healthy connection and dependency. We do not use Cups to tell you that you will find love or that you must open your heart; we use them as mirrors for how you relate to feeling and to others.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="relationships-heading">
        <h2 id="relationships-heading">Cups in Relationships</h2>
        <p>In relationships, Cups often touch on partnership, passion, and emotional exchange. The suit can reflect the quality of connection — mutuality, harmony, or the work of healing after hurt. It may also point to phases of withdrawal, grief, or the need to leave what no longer fulfills. Cups do not predict whether a relationship will last or whether you will meet someone new. They invite awareness of how you give and receive love, how you handle emotional conflict, and what you are truly seeking in connection. Reversed Cups in a relational context may point to blocked feeling, idealization, or the need to face what has been avoided.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="career-heading">
        <h2 id="career-heading">Cups in Career & Direction</h2>
        <p>In career and life direction, Cups often symbolize the emotional and relational dimension of work — whether you feel aligned with what you do, whether your environment supports or drains you, and how you balance ambition with the need for meaning and connection. The suit may reflect the choice to leave a role that no longer fulfills or to invest in work that engages the heart. We do not use Cups to promise a dream job or to advise you to follow your passion at all costs. We use them to support reflection on how your work makes you feel and what you need from your professional life beyond status or pay.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="numerology-heading">
        <h2 id="numerology-heading">Numerology in the Suit of Cups</h2>
        <p>The numbered cards (Ace through Ten) in Cups can be read as a loose emotional progression. The Ace often represents the overflow — new feeling, the opening of the heart, or a surge of intuition. The Two can suggest partnership and mutual exchange. The Three may reflect celebration, friendship, and shared joy. The Four can symbolize contemplation or the sense of something overlooked. The Five often touches loss, grief, or fixation on what is spilled. The Six may reflect nostalgia and the influence of the past. The Seven can suggest many options, fantasy, and the need for clarity. The Eight often points to walking away and seeking deeper meaning. The Nine may reflect contentment and emotional abundance. The Ten can suggest emotional completion and the ideal of home. This progression is not a fixed script; it is a way to notice how the number and the suit interact — early numbers often lean toward new feeling and connection, later numbers toward depth, loss, integration, or release.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="court-heading">
        <h2 id="court-heading">Court Cards in Cups</h2>
        <p>The court cards in Cups (Page, Knight, Queen, King) are often read as aspects of personality or as people who carry Cups energy. The <strong>Page of Cups</strong> may reflect sensitivity, creativity, and messages from the heart — a new emotional or intuitive impulse. The <strong>Knight of Cups</strong> often symbolizes the pursuit of feeling, invitation, or romantic gesture — following the heart with care, sometimes with a touch of idealism. The <strong>Queen of Cups</strong> may reflect empathy, intuition, and emotional depth — your capacity to feel and to nurture, or someone who embodies that. The <strong>King of Cups</strong> can suggest emotional mastery, calm, and the ability to hold space — balanced feeling or supportive presence. Court cards do not predict who will appear in your life; they offer archetypal angles for reflection, including the possibility that you are being invited to embody more (or less) of that energy yourself.</p>
