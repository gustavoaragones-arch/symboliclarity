      <h1 class="article__title">Wheel of Fortune — Tarot Card Meaning</h1>

      <p class="article__intro">The Wheel of Fortune in tarot is often shown as a great wheel turning, figures rising and falling, symbols of cycles and change. In symbolic interpretation, this card does not predict good or bad luck. It reflects an archetype of impermanence: the recognition that life moves in cycles, that circumstances shift beyond our control, and that our relationship to change — whether we resist it, fear it, or find a way to meet it — shapes our experience. When this card appears, it may point to a time when something is turning: a phase ending, a new one beginning, or the unsettling sense that the ground is moving. Emotionally, it can suggest both possibility and vulnerability — the excitement of the new and the anxiety of the unknown. The Wheel is less about fate and more about the psychology of living in a world that does not stand still.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="upright-heading">
        <h2 id="upright-heading">Upright Reflection</h2>
        <p>When the Wheel of Fortune appears upright, it often reflects a period when change is in the air — whether you initiated it or it arrived unbidden. You may feel the shift in your circumstances, your mood, or your sense of what is possible. The card does not promise that the turn will be for the better or the worse. It symbolizes the psychological stance of acknowledging that life moves — and that your response to that movement matters as much as the movement itself.</p>
        <p>In practice, this can show up as a job change, a relationship shift, a health development, or an internal realization that things cannot stay as they were. The Wheel can represent the part of you that knows that clinging to the way things were is a form of suffering — and the part that is scared of what the next turn might bring. The upright card invites reflection on how you meet change: with openness, with resistance, or with a mix of both. It may also point to the relief that can come when we stop pretending we can freeze time — when we accept that the wheel turns and we can choose how we stand in relation to it.</p>
        <p>Growth here may involve loosening the need to control outcomes. The Wheel suggests that some forces are larger than individual will — economics, health, other people’s choices, the simple passage of time. That does not mean passivity; it means distinguishing between what you can influence and what you must learn to live with. Some people find that this card appears when they are ready to release a rigid narrative about how life “should” go. Others encounter it when they need to recognize that a turn is happening and to prepare, as best they can, for what comes next.</p>
        <p>If you are reflecting with this card, consider where the wheel is turning in your life and how you are meeting that turn. The Wheel often symbolizes the wisdom of accepting change while still choosing how you respond.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="reversed-heading">
        <h2 id="reversed-heading">Reversed Reflection</h2>
        <p>The Wheel of Fortune reversed often reflects a blockage or resistance in that same territory of change and cycles. It may symbolize a time when you feel stuck — as if the wheel has stopped or is turning against you — or when you are resisting a change that is already underway. Reversed, the card does not mean that change will not come. It can indicate that the energy of the Wheel is delayed, denied, or that you are struggling to find your footing as the ground shifts.</p>
        <p>Some people encounter this when they have been through a difficult turn and are still reeling — unable to integrate what happened or to trust that another turn could bring something different. The reversal can reflect the sense that life is unfair, that you have no agency, or that you are at the mercy of forces you cannot see. It may also point to the refusal to accept change: holding on to a situation, an identity, or a hope long after the wheel has moved. The reversed Wheel invites awareness of where you are fighting the turn instead of moving with it.</p>
        <p>At other times, the reversal can suggest that a change is coming but is not yet visible — a period of preparation or waiting. The card can invite you to consider what you can do to build resilience and flexibility, so that when the wheel turns again you are not only reacting but responding with intention. Integrating the reversed energy often involves accepting that some phases are slow, and that patience is not the same as passivity.</p>
        <p>If this card appears reversed in your reflection, consider whether you are resisting change or feeling abandoned by it. Finding a stance that is neither rigid nor helpless often restores a healthier relationship with the Wheel.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="relationships-heading">
        <h2 id="relationships-heading">In Relationships</h2>
        <p>The Wheel of Fortune in the context of relationships often reflects the natural cycles of connection — the ups and downs, the phases of closeness and distance, the external events that put pressure on the partnership. It can symbolize a turning point: a move, a loss, a new commitment, or the recognition that the relationship is changing whether you planned it or not. In established partnerships, the card may point to the need to accept that the relationship will not stay static — and to work with change rather than against it.</p>
        <p>Emotionally, the Wheel can represent the vulnerability of loving in an uncertain world — and the courage to stay connected even when the wheel turns. When reversed in a relational context, it may reflect resistance to change, the sense that the relationship is stuck, or the fear that a turn will bring loss. Reflection might focus on how you and your partner meet change together, and what would make it easier to move through transitions as a team.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="career-heading">
        <h2 id="career-heading">In Career & Direction</h2>
        <p>In career and life direction, the Wheel of Fortune often symbolizes external shifts — market changes, organizational restructures, opportunities that appear or disappear. It may reflect the recognition that your career is not entirely in your hands; timing, luck, and larger systems play a role. The card does not tell you to give up agency; it invites reflection on how you respond when the wheel turns — with adaptability, with preparation, or with resistance.</p>
        <p>Transitions and turning points can be in view: the Wheel can represent a promotion, a layoff, a pivot, or the simple recognition that the industry or the role is changing. If you are in flux, this card often suggests that building flexibility and a broad sense of identity — not only “what I do” — can help you move through the turn with more stability.</p>

      <section class="meaning-reflect" aria-labelledby="growth-heading">
        <h2 id="growth-heading">As Personal Growth</h2>
        <p>As a mirror for personal growth, the Wheel of Fortune highlights the relationship between control and acceptance. Growth often requires coming to terms with the fact that we cannot hold everything still — that we will age, that people will leave, that plans will shift. The card can reflect the work of developing a stance toward change that is neither naive nor cynical: open to possibility while grounded in the reality that not everything is in our hands.</p>
        <p>Self-awareness here might include noticing when you blame yourself for every downturn or credit yourself for every upturn — and what a more balanced view might offer. The Wheel invites a humble question: how can I meet the turns of life with more grace and less rigidity?</p>
