# Phase 6.1 — Internal Link Reinforcement (Implementation Guide)

## Objective
Increase crawl depth, topical clustering, and contextual semantic reinforcement via **in-paragraph contextual links** without overlinking or clutter.

## Target per card page (Minor Arcana)
- **4–5 new contextual links** integrated into body text
- **1 Tarot Meaning Library link** in the first 300 words (intro)
- Mix: **2 same-suit**, **1 cross-suit**, **1 Major Arcana**, **1 suit hub**

## Placement
| Section | Links to add |
|--------|----------------|
| **Intro** | Add before "We offer reflective…": `Explore all cards in the <a href="/tarot/meanings/">Tarot Meaning Library</a>. ` |
| **Upright** | 2 links: same-suit card(s) and/or one Major Arcana (e.g. The Fool, The Hermit, The Tower, The World, Justice, Temperance, The Empress, The Emperor, The Magician) |
| **Reversed** | 1 link: cross-suit card (e.g. same number or theme from another suit) |
| **Career OR Relationships** | 1 link: same-suit or thematically related card |
| **As Personal Growth** | 1 link: suit hub e.g. `the <a href="/tarot/meanings/swords/">suit of Swords</a>` (or Wands/Cups/Pentacles) |

## Rules
- Links must read naturally inside sentences.
- Use **card name only** as anchor text (e.g. "the Ace of Pentacles", "The Hermit").
- Do not add links in "When Appears With Other Cards", "Related Cards", or FAQ (those already have links).
- Do not change structure, schema, or word count significantly.
- Vary Major Arcana across pages (Fool, Hermit, Tower, World, Justice, Temperance, Empress, Emperor, Magician).
- Cross-suit: link to same number or thematic counterpart (e.g. Ace of Wands, Nine of Cups, Ten of Pentacles).

## Status (as of this doc)
- **Pentacles:** All 14 cards updated (Ace–Ten, Page, Knight, Queen, King).
- **Swords:** Ace of Swords updated. Remaining: Two–Ten, Page, Knight, Queen, King (13 cards).
- **Wands:** Not yet started (14 cards).
- **Cups:** Not yet started (14 cards).
- **Major Arcana:** Not yet started (22 cards). Use same intro + 3–4 contextual links (no suit hub; link to related Minors and Majors).

## Suit hubs
- Swords: `/tarot/meanings/swords/`
- Wands: `/tarot/meanings/wands/`
- Cups: `/tarot/meanings/cups/`
- Pentacles: `/tarot/meanings/pentacles/`
- Meanings hub: `/tarot/meanings/`

## Example (already applied)
**Ace of Pentacles — Upright:**  
"…steady effort rather than sudden change — the kind of patience the **Seven of Pentacles** also invites."  
"Unlike the sudden shift of **The Tower**, this energy builds slowly."

**Ace of Pentacles — Reversed:**  
"Where the **Ace of Wands** leans toward immediate spark, the reversed Ace of Pentacles…"

**Ace of Pentacles — Career:**  
"…over time — territory that the **Eight of Pentacles** also explores…"

**Ace of Pentacles — Personal Growth:**  
"This theme reflects the broader energy of the **suit of Pentacles**…"
