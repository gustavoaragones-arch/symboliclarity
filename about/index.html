    <section aria-labelledby="calm-space-heading">
      <h2 id="calm-space-heading">A Calm Space for Reflection</h2>
      <p>Symboliclarity offers symbolic tools for reflection — not prediction. When you notice a recurring number, draw a tarot card, or sit with a yes-or-no prompt, you are not receiving a message from elsewhere. You are creating space to notice what is already present in your mind and body. Our platform is designed to support that pause: to offer language and imagery that can help you articulate what you may already feel but have not yet named. We avoid destiny language, future claims, and guaranteed outcomes. Nothing here tells you what will happen. Everything here invites you to consider what matters to you right now.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="what-we-do-heading">
      <h2 id="what-we-do-heading">What We Do</h2>
      <p>We provide structured reflection frameworks. Our <a href="/tarot/">tarot tool</a> offers a three-card spread with reflective interpretations — past influence, present energy, and unfolding direction. Our <a href="/oracle/">yes-or-no oracle</a> combines a directional nudge with reflective prompts and suggested actions. Our <a href="/symbolism/">symbolism guides</a> explore how archetypes and patterns function as mirrors for self-inquiry. Each tool is designed to be grounded and calm, free of mystical certainty. They serve as starting points for your own reflection, not as authorities that tell you what to think or do.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="what-we-dont-heading">
      <h2 id="what-we-dont-heading">What We Don't Do</h2>
      <p>We do not predict the future. Our tools do not forecast outcomes, foresee events, or guarantee results. We do not offer psychic services, mediumship, or any form of divination that claims access to hidden knowledge. We do not provide medical, legal, or financial advice. Nothing on this site substitutes for professional support. If you are facing health concerns, legal matters, or significant decisions, please consult qualified professionals. Our content is for reflection and perspective only.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="why-symbolism-heading">
      <h2 id="why-symbolism-heading">Why Symbolism Matters</h2>
      <p>Symbols have long served as mirrors. Archetypes — recurring patterns of imagery and meaning — appear across cultures and time. When you engage with a tarot image, a number sequence, or a simple prompt, you are working with your own associations and intuitions. Psychological projection and pattern recognition play a role: what you see in a symbol often reflects what you are already processing. The value lies in the process of reflection itself — slowing down, giving attention to a question, and allowing room for insight to surface. <a href="/symbolism/">Understanding symbolism</a> can deepen that process.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="thoughtful-browsing-heading">
      <h2 id="thoughtful-browsing-heading">Designed for Thoughtful Browsing</h2>
      <p>We aim for slow design. No aggressive pop-ups, no urgent CTAs, no pressure to click faster. The layout is spacious, the typography readable, the tone steady. We know that many people visit during uncertain moments — late at night, between decisions, when clarity feels far away. Emotional validation matters: it is okay to not know. Our tools offer a quiet place to reflect, without hype and without promises. They are meant to feel useful, not urgent.</p>
