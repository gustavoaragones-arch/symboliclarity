    <h1 class="article__title">How Symbolic Tools Work</h1>
    <p class="article__intro">Symboliclarity uses symbolic systems to create moments of pause. Here is how our tools function — with full transparency about what they do and do not do.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="randomization-heading">
      <h2 id="randomization-heading">Randomization & Reflection</h2>
      <p>Our interactive tools — the <a href="/tarot/">tarot reflection</a> and the <a href="/oracle/">yes-or-no oracle</a> — use randomization. Cards are drawn through algorithmic logic: a random selection from the deck. Oracle responses are generated by combining randomly chosen elements from predefined sets. We do not track your input, store your questions, or tailor responses based on your history. The outcome is determined by chance. The randomness serves a practical purpose: it introduces variety, reduces the temptation to search for a "right" answer, and keeps the focus on reflection rather than on whether the system "got it right." You are invited to sit with whatever comes up and consider its relevance to your situation.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="symbolism-heading">
      <h2 id="symbolism-heading">Symbolism as Language</h2>
      <p>Symbols function as a kind of language. Archetypes — recurring patterns of imagery and meaning — appear across cultures and time. The tarot deck draws on symbols like the Fool, the Tower, and the Star. Number sequences carry shared associations. These archetypes are presented as lenses for reflection. When you encounter a symbol, your mind connects it to your own experiences, questions, and feelings. The value is in that connection — in taking a moment to ask yourself what a particular image or prompt might mean for you, rather than receiving a fixed interpretation from an external source. For a deeper look at how symbolism works, see our <a href="/symbolism/">Understanding Symbolism</a> page.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="interpretation-heading">
      <h2 id="interpretation-heading">Interpretation Is Personal</h2>
      <p>We encourage reflection rather than prediction. Each tool provides prompts — short phrases or questions designed to help you think more deeply. These prompts are general enough to apply to many contexts but specific enough to feel meaningful. Two people receiving the same tarot card or oracle response may take away different insights. Your interpretation is central. We encourage you to sit with what resonates and to let go of what does not. The tools are aids, not authorities. They support your own process of reflection; they do not tell you what to do or what will happen.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="tool-not-decider-heading">
      <h2 id="tool-not-decider-heading">A Tool, Not a Decision Maker</h2>
      <p>User agency matters. The tools here do not make decisions for you. They do not predict outcomes, diagnose conditions, or offer advice on medical, legal, or financial matters. They create a pause — a moment to step back, consider a question, and notice what arises. The decisions you make remain yours. The responsibility for your choices stays with you. We offer symbolic reflection as a way to support that process, not to replace it.</p>
